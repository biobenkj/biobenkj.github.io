Graduate work:
I joined the [Abramovitch lab](http://www.abramovitchlab.com) in early 2012 as a graduate
student in the [Microbiology and Molecular Genetics](mmg.msu.edu) at Michigan State University.
In the lab we study how *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb) is able to sense and orchestrate adaptive
responses to environmental cues.

Using a fluorescent reporter strain, we screened >300,000 compounds to find inhibitors of 
pH-dependent adaptation. Using chemical genetics, NGS techniques, and a variety of other
biological assays, we identified some promising candidates. 


Postdoctoral work:
I joined the [Triche lab](https://trichelab.vai.org/) and [Shen lab](https://shenlab.vai.org/) in 2019
as a postdoctoral fellow at the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, MI. The common theme between
both labs is trying to develop new methods and techniques to address the dynamics of epigenetics and metabolism
in childhood and female reproductive cancers.
